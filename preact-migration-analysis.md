â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ EndGameModal
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ResumeGameModal
```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### 1. **State Management**
```javascript
// Game State Context
const GameContext = createContext({
  currentLevel: 1,
  score: 0,
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
  questionsOrder: [],
  gameData: {},
  actions: {
    startGame,
    answerQuestion,
    nextLevel,
    resetGame
  }
});

// Audio Context
const AudioContext = createContext({
  isInitialized: false,
  voices: [],
  playSound,
  speakText,
  initializeAudio
});
```

#### 2. **Key Custom Hooks**
```javascript
// Game logic hook
const useGameLogic = () => {
  // Handle game state, question generation, scoring
};

// Audio functionality hook
const useAudio = () => {
  // Handle TTS, sound effects, voice selection
};

// Persistence hook
const useLocalStorage = (key, defaultValue) => {
  // Handle localStorage operations with state sync
};
```

#### 3. **Build Configuration**
- **Bundler**: Vite or Webpack with Preact preset
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Audio**: Keep Tone.js as external dependency
- **Output**: Optimized static files for deployment

### Migration Timeline & Effort Estimation

#### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- Setup Preact project with build tools
- Create basic component structure
- Implement core contexts (Game, Audio)
- Migrate static components (StartScreen, Modals)

#### Phase 2: Game Logic (2-3 weeks)
- Implement game state management
- Migrate question generation logic
- Create interactive components (OptionButtons, TargetDisplay)
- Implement scoring and progress tracking

#### Phase 3: Audio & Polish (1-2 weeks)
- Integrate audio functionality
- Implement TTS and sound effects
- Add animations and transitions
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (1 week)
- Unit testing for components
- Integration testing for game flow
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing and optimization

**Total Estimated Effort: 5-8 weeks for complete migration**

### Potential Challenges & Mitigation

#### 1. **Audio Integration Complexity**
- **Challenge**: Web Audio API and TTS integration with component lifecycle
- **Mitigation**: Create dedicated audio service with React integration layer

#### 2. **State Synchronization**
- **Challenge**: Complex game state with localStorage persistence
- **Mitigation**: Use custom hooks and context providers for centralized state

#### 3. **Performance on Mobile Devices**
- **Challenge**: Maintaining smooth performance on older mobile devices
- **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, code splitting, performance monitoring

#### 4. **SEO and Accessibility**
- **Challenge**: Maintaining accessibility features in component-based architecture
- **Mitigation**: Proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation

### Alternative Approaches Considered

#### 1. **Incremental Migration**
- **Approach**: Gradually replace parts of the app with Preact components
- **Pros**: Lower risk, can test components individually
- **Cons**: Complex integration, maintaining two codebases

#### 2. **Framework Alternatives**
- **Vue.js**: Similar size to Preact, good performance
- **Svelte**: Compile-time optimization, smaller bundles
- **Alpine.js**: Minimal migration, keeps current HTML structure
- **Recommendation**: Preact remains optimal for React-like development with minimal overhead

### Conclusion

The migration to Preact is **highly recommended** and technically feasible. The current application's single-file architecture has reached maintainability limits, and Preact offers the optimal balance of modern development practices, performance, and bundle size for this educational application.

The component-based architecture will significantly improve code organization, make future feature additions easier, and provide better performance on mobile devices where the target audience (children) typically uses the application.

**Next Steps:**
1. Setup Preact development environment
2. Create proof-of-concept with 2-3 core components
3. Validate audio integration approach
4. Begin systematic migration following the proposed phases
